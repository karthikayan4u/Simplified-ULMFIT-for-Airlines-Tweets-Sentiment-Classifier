# Simplified-ULMFIT-for-Airlines-Tweets-Sentiment-Classifier
A Supervised ULMFiT model to Twitter US Airlines Sentiment.

This is a repository created purely with my understandings on ULMFIT by executing it on [Twitter Airlines Sentiment](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment?rvi=1) hosted at kaggle.

Note:
I have not included weights.You can just run and it just takes few minutes to train and predict.
I recommend you to tweak the hyparameters to get even more results.
